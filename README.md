## 1. Introduction

In this project, we build a Concert Ticket Selling System, which offers a user-friendly website where Admin can create, filter, modify concert events, set ticket classes and prices, and monitor ticket sales and transactions. Admin can also create venues, modify their seat maps, and view seat information associated users. Admin is able to view all user account information and account activities as well.

User is able to login, register a account, perform forget-password on account and view, update their account information.

Users can view, filter and search on corresponding concert event information, select desired tickets and seats through an interactive map, make online payments, and receive electronic tickets.

The implemented Concert Ticket Selling System can be access from the URL [https://concert-ticket-selling-system.vercel.app/?authkey=eie4432davidmike](https://concert-ticket-selling-system.vercel.app/?authkey=eie4432davidmike)

## 7. API Specification & Implementation

Totally, the system has 6 routers, including `auth`, `account`, `events`, `venues`, `user`, `order`.

API specification is about which route is doing what functions. You should describe the function, input/output, and the brief algorithm to do that.

### 7.1 `auth` router

**POST `auth/login`**
- Input: `username`, `password`
- Output: 
  - `{ "status": "failed", "reason": "User `" + username + "` is disabled" }`
  - `{ status: "success", user:{username: username, role: user.role} }`
  - `{ "status": "failed", "reason": "Incorrect username and password" }`
- Brief Algorithm: 
  1. Check if the user exists in the database
  2. If the user exists, increment the login attempts
  3. Check if the password is correct
  4. Check if the user is enabled
  5. Return the result in each case

**POST `/auth/register`**
- **Input**: `username`, `password`, `nickname`, `email`, `gender`, `birthDate`, `image`
- **Output**:
  - `{ status: 'failed', message: 'Username must be at least 3 characters' }` for short username.
  - `{ status: 'failed', message: 'Username [username] already exists' }` for existing username.
  - `{ status: 'failed', message: 'Password must be at least 8 characters' }` for short password.
  - `{ status: 'success', user: { username: username, role: role } }` on successful registration.
  - `{ status: 'failed', message: 'Missing fields' }` for missing mandatory fields.
- **Brief Algorithm**:
  1. Validate provided username and password for length constraints.
  2. Check if username already exists in the database.
  3. Create a new user in the database with provided details.
  4. Return the appropriate response based on the operation's success or failure.

**POST `/auth/logout`**
- **Input**: void
- **Output**:
  - `{ status: "failed", message: "Unauthorized" }` if not logged in.

  2. If logged in, end the session and clear session data.
  3. Respond with appropriate message based on the user's login status.

**GET `/auth/me`**
- **Input**: void
- **Output**:
  - `{ "status": "success", "user": { "username": [username], "role": [role] } }` if logged in.
  - `{ status: "failed", message: "Unauthorized" }` if not logged in or user has logged in for more than 10 minutes.
- **Brief Algorithm**:
  1. Check if the user is currently logged in based on the session data.
  2. Check if the user has logged in for more than 10 minutes, by comparing the current time with the last login time stored in the session.
  3. Return the logged-in user's username and role if logged in and not timed out.
  4. Respond with an unauthorized message if not logged in or logged in for more than 10 minutes.
